# Journal Rules

Every journal entry MUST follow this structure:

## 1. Historical Summary (Required)
A brief chronological summary of ALL work done on this project, from the beginning to now. This ensures any reader can understand the full context without reading previous entries.

Format:
```
### Project Timeline
- [Date/Entry 1]: Brief description of what was accomplished
- [Date/Entry 2]: Brief description of what was accomplished
- ...
- [Current]: What this entry covers
```

## 2. Current State (Required)
- What components exist and their status (working/broken/partial)
- Test status (X/Y tests passing)
- Key files and their purpose

## 3. Work Done This Session (Required)
- Specific changes made
- Problems solved
- Decisions taken and why

## 4. Next Steps (Required)
- Concrete actionable items
- Priority order
- Known blockers

## 5. Architecture Notes (If Changed)
- Only include if architecture was modified
- Keep diagrams simple (ASCII)

**File Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-NN-brief-description.md` (NN = sequence number for multiple entries per day)

**Keep entries concise**. Target ~100-200 lines max. If longer, you're including too much detail.
